# 📄🚀 LLM Document Analysis API

## 🌟 Project Overview

This project provides an API built with **FastAPI**, **Uvicorn**, and **Pydantic** to analyze documents using Large Language Models (LLMs) via the **Langchain** framework. Users can submit documents and receive insights generated by the LLM. The project is designed for performance, ease of use, and scalability.

## ✨ Features

- 🤖 **LLM Analysis of pre-uploaded documents**: Analyze documents using powerful LLMs (via Langchain).
- 📊 **JSON Responses**: Receive results in a structured JSON format.
- ⚡ **Real-Time**: Leverages FastAPI and Uvicorn for fast, real-time processing.
- ✅ **Input Validation**: Uses Pydantic to validate input data.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **FastAPI** 🖥️: API framework
- **Uvicorn** 🚀: ASGI server for running FastAPI
- **Pydantic** ✅: Data validation and parsing
- **Langchain** 🧠: Framework to interact with LLMs

## 🧠 Langchain Integration

We use **Langchain** to interface with LLMs for document processing. The models analyze the input text, summarize it, and generate other key insights.
